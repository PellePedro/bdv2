The devcontainer includes a frontend UI that is running on port 9080 and started with the command.
```
npm run start-server
```

The backend is running on port 3000 and can be started with the command.
```
npm run start-server
```

The frontend loads the logic in the adapter directory to get the list of books from the backend.
In this assignment you will refactor the adapter to use the fetch API to talk to the backend.


## Assignment
Inspect the adapter/assignment-1.ts file. and not how that the listBooks function makes a request to the backend and returns the result.
